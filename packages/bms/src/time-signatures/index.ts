/**
 * A TimeSignatures is a collection of time signature values
 * index by measure number.
 *
 * The measure number starts from 0.
 * By default, each measure has a measure size of 1
 * (which represents the common 4/4 time signature)
 *
 * ## Example
 *
 * If you have a BMS like this:
 *
 * ```
 * #00102:0.75
 * #00103:1.25
 * ```
 *
 * Having parsed it using a {Compiler} into a {BMSChart},
 * you can access the {TimeSignatures} object:
 *
 * ```js
 * var timeSignatures = bmsChart.timeSignatures
 * ```
 *
 * Note that you can also use the constructor
 * to create a {TimeSignatures} from scratch.
 *
 * One of the most useful use case of this class
 * is to convert the measure and fraction into beat number.
 *
 * ```js
 * timeSignatures.measureToBeat(0, 0.000) // =>  0.0
 * timeSignatures.measureToBeat(0, 0.500) // =>  2.0
 * timeSignatures.measureToBeat(1, 0.000) // =>  4.0
 * timeSignatures.measureToBeat(1, 0.500) // =>  5.5
 * timeSignatures.measureToBeat(2, 0.000) // =>  7.0
 * timeSignatures.measureToBeat(2, 0.500) // =>  9.5
 * timeSignatures.measureToBeat(3, 0.000) // => 12.0
 * ```
